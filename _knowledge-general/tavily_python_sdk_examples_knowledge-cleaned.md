"[582] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi\'s leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[583][584][585] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become "more one of the group, more Argentine", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[581]\nComparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost–Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[586][587]\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[588][589] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[160] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d\'Or to Ronaldo\'s five,[590] seven FIFA World\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\'s four.[591] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[160][592] On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi\'s record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009;[281][282] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe\'s top-five leagues.[282][283] Following his brace in a 5–0 away win against Alavés in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\nDespite Messi\'s individual form, Barcelona\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\'s history – drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]','score':0.98567,'raw_content':None},{'title':"Lionel Messi | Biography, Barcelona, PSG, Ballon d'Or, Inter Miami ...",'url':'https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lionel-Messi','content':'In early 2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008–09 season by helping FC Barcelona capture the club’s first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season): the team won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d’Or. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team’s third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived “retirement” lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team. Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour.','score':0.9818,'raw_content':None},{'title':'Lionel Messi: Biography, Soccer Player, Inter Miami CF, Athlete','url':'https://www.biography.com/athletes/lionel-messi','content':'The following year, after Messi heavily criticized the referees in the wake of a 2-0 loss to Brazil in the Copa America semifinals, the Argentine captain was slapped with a three-game ban by the South American Football Confederation.

# The Burning Man Festival 2023: A Festival Turned Mud Fest
**Abstract:** The Burning Man Festival of 2023 in Nevada’s Black Rock desert will be remembered for a significant event: a heavy rainfall that turned the festival site into a muddy mess, testing the community spirit of the annual event attendees and stranding tens of thousands of festival-goers. **Keywords:** Burning Man Festival, flooding, rainfall, mud, community spirit, Nevada, Black Rock desert, stranded attendees, shelter
---
## 1. Introduction
The Burning Man Festival, an annual event known for its art installations, free spirit, and community ethos, faced an unprecedented challenge in 2023 due to heavy rains that flooded the festival site, turning it into a foot-deep mud pit[^1^][^2^]. The festival, held in Nevada's Black Rock desert, is known for its harsh weather conditions, including heat and dust, but this was the first time the event was affected to such an extent by rainfall[^4^].
## 2. Impact of the Rain
The heavy rains started on Friday, and more than a half-inch of rain fell, leading to flooding that turned the playa into a foot-deep mud pit[^2^]. The roads were closed due to the muddy conditions, stranding tens of thousands of festival-goers[^2^][^5^]. The burners, as the attendees are known, were forced to lean on each other for help[^2^].
## 3. Community Spirit Tested
The unexpected weather conditions put the Burning Man community spirit to the test[^1^]. Festival-goers found themselves sheltering in place, conserving food and water, and helping each other out[^3^]. For instance, Mark Fromson, who had been staying in an RV, was forced to find shelter at another camp due to the rains, where fellow burners provided him with food and cover[^2^].
## 4. Exodus After Rain
Despite the challenges, the festival-goers made the best of the situation. Once the rain stopped and things dried up a bit, the party quickly resumed[^3^]. A day later than scheduled, the massive wooden effigy known as the Man was set ablaze[^5^]. As the situation improved, thousands of Burning Man attendees began their mass exodus from the festival site[^5^].
## 5. Conclusion
The Burning Man Festival of 2023 will be remembered for the community spirit shown by the attendees in the face of heavy rainfall and flooding. Although the event was marred by the weather, the festival-goers managed to make the best of the situation, demonstrating the resilience and camaraderie that the Burning Man Festival is known for.
